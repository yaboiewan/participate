I have chosen to adapt, “A Terrible Night”, directed by George Meiles in 1896. The film is about 1 minute long and features George himself, acting as a man who is simply getting into bed in order to sleep. After the man lies down, a giant bug begins crawling up onto his bed, at which point the man sits up frantically. The bug continues to crawl up a wall next to the bed, and the man takes a broom and squishes the bug against the wall. The man proceeds to essentially body slam the bug after it has fallen from the wall and onto his bed. He then picks the bug up, puts it in a bowl, and goes back to sleep. I found this movie remarkable, mainly because of how relatable it is. I think, even in the present day, we all have once feared something like this happening to us as we fall asleep, and despite the humorous special effect used to make the “bug” move, the film is accessible by anyone, from anywhere, in any time period. 
	My game will consist of a man with a broom whos purpose is to squash a bug that is frantically running around on the wall. Players will control the man using the arrow keys, and use the spacebar to try and hit the bug. They will have a certain amount of time to hit the bug, and if they cannot do it before their time runs out, they “fall asleep”, and  lose the game since the bug will bite them in their sleep. The game will virtually look similar to the still shot used in the film, which depicts a room with a bed, furniture, and a wall.
